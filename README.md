- Download the autograder from GitHub: `https://github.com/CSE546-Cloud-Computing/CSE546-FALL-2025.git`
  - In order to clone the GitHub repository follow the below steps:
  - `git clone https://github.com/nehavadnere/CSE546-FALL-2025.git`
  - `cd CSE546-FALL-2025/`
  - `git checkout project-1-part-1`
- Create a directory `submissions` in the CSE546-FALL-2025 directory and move your zip file to the submissions directory.

## Prepare to run the autograder
- Install Python: `sudo apt install python3`
- Populate the `class_roster.csv`
  - If you are a student; replace the given template only with your details.
  - If you are a grader; use the class roster for the entire class

## Run the autograder
- Run the autograder: `python3 autograder.py --num_requests 100 --img_folder="<dataset folder path>" --pred_file="<output classification csv file path>"`
  ```
  python3 autograder.py --help
  usage: autograder.py [-h] [--img_folder IMG_FOLDER] [--pred_file PRED_FILE] [--num_requests NUM_REQUESTS]

  - Validate if the zip file adheres to the submission guidelines as mentioned in the project document.
    - If Yes; proceed to next step
    - If No; allocate 0 grade points and proceed to the next submission
  - The autograder extracts the credentials.txt from the submission and parses the entries.
